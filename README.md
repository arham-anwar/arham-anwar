I'm a Machine Learning enthusiast with a couple of years in management consulting. These days, I'm having a blast diving deep into data science at McGill University's Master in Management Analytics program. Currently, I'm doing some fun ML coding at Aldo Group. ðŸ¥¾

## ðŸ›  What I Tinker With
- **Descriptive Analytics:** Unveiling hidden patterns with EDA, Clustering, and Anomaly detection
- **Predictive Analytics:** Building fancy regression & classification models, Time series forecasting, Reinforcement learning
- **Inferential/Causal Analytics:** Playing detective with Statistical modeling, A/B testing, and Propensity score matching
- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch Lightning wizardry, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and even Fine Tuning LLMs
- **Production:** Containerizing with Docker, crafting APIs, CI/CD pipelines, and keeping an eye on model drift
- **Cloud Platforms:** Azure ML, AWS, GCP, and some Kubernetes magic
- **Data Visualization:** Turning data into stories with Tableau, Power BI, Streamlit, and Plotly
- **Text & Social Media Analytics:** Making sense of text with NLP, Sentiment analysis, Topic modeling

## ðŸ§° My Toolbox
- **Languages:** Python, R, SQL, Bash scripting, Julia, Scala
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** PyTorch Lightning, MLFlow, Azure SDK, Firebase, Streamlit, Keras, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers (Hugging Face)

## ðŸ“œ Certified Data Nerd
- Azure Data Science Associate (DP100)
- Apache Spark Fundamentals
- Databricks Lakehouse Fundamentals

## ðŸŒ± Let's Connect!
I'm always on the lookout for cool ML projects and love collaborating with fellow data enthusiasts. Got a project that needs some data wizardryâ€”or just want to chat about the latest tech trends? Drop me a line!
